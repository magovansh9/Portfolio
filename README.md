This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/docs/introduction/getting-started?utm_source=readme).

## Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

## Sanity

## React

- Use console.logs directly in JSX to identify issue
- Use ReactToolTip to highlight components
- When working with specific packages and dependencies, one cannot necessarily style them. Written CSS does not hold a higher precedence to the default styling eg: React Tooltip. To overcome this, add !important to the end of every CSS property (not recommended, but necessary as per use case)
- Add a line between external and internal imports

### Higher Order Components

- Components that are present on every page of a website. Eliminate redundancy professionaly and creatively by using higher-order components.

- Use HOC to wrap smaller components that share similar functionalities

- App wrap for social icon and navigations dots. Motion wrap for wrapping every component in a framer motion div in order to achieve appropriate animations for every section.

## SCSS

- Allows nesting, makes the styling process more intuitive

- To make the hovering more interactive, add a div and style it to a shape such that it indicates an item being hovered over

- use of media screens to target multiple screens

### BEM methodology for clean CSS

## Framer Motion
